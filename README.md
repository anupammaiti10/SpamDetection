# SpamDetection

## Overview

SpamDetection is a project designed to identify and classify spam messages using machine learning techniques. The repository primarily consists of Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to understand, explore, and modify the code.

## Features

- Preprocessing of text data for spam detection.
- Implementation of machine learning models for spam classification.
- Evaluation metrics for the performance of the models.
- Fully interactive notebooks for experimentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anupammaiti10/SpamDetection.git
   cd SpamDetection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the notebooks and start exploring the project.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset for spam detection.
2. Preprocess the data using the provided functions in the notebook.
3. Train the model using the pre-defined algorithms or modify them as needed.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
